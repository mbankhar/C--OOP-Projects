C++ OOP Projects
Welcome to the C++ OOP Projects repository. This collection of exercises is designed as a guided journey to learn Object-Oriented Programming in C++ through hands-on projects. Each module introduces new concepts and challenges, building from basic constructs up to advanced OOP techniques.

Overview
These projects are organized into modules that progressively increase in complexity:

Module 00 – Fundamental Concepts
Start with the basics: namespaces, classes, member functions, I/O streams, initialization lists, static members, and const correctness. Exercises such as Megaphone and My Awesome PhoneBook set the foundation.

Module 01 – Memory Management & Basic Pointers
Dive into memory allocation, pointers to members, references, and control structures with exercises like BraiiiiiiinnnzzzZ and Zombie Horde. These projects help you understand when to use stack versus heap allocation.

Module 02 – Operator Overloading & Orthodox Canonical Form
Learn how to implement your classes in the Orthodox Canonical Form while exploring operator overloading and ad-hoc polymorphism. Exercises include building a fixed-point number class that challenges your understanding of numbers in C++.

Module 03 – Inheritance
Discover how inheritance works by creating base classes and deriving new ones. Projects like ClapTrap illustrate how attributes and behaviors can be inherited and extended.

Module 04 – Subtype Polymorphism & Abstract Classes
This module introduces runtime polymorphism and abstract classes. Implement class hierarchies with concrete examples (such as animals with overridden sound methods) to see how derived classes can specialize behavior, including experiments with “wrong” polymorphism.

Module 05 – Repetition & Exceptions
Understand exception handling and robust code design. Exercises like the Bureaucrat and Form projects simulate real-world scenarios with error handling and repetitive operations, enforcing best practices to prevent resource leaks.

Module 06 – C++ Casts
Explore the various type casts in C++ by converting between scalar types and implementing a ScalarConverter class. This module helps demystify the nuances of C++ type conversion.

Module 07 – Templates
Get introduced to generic programming with function templates. Exercises require you to implement functions such as swap, min, and max that can work with any type, providing a flexible approach to coding.

Module 08 – Templated Containers, Iterators & Algorithms
Learn to harness the power of the Standard Template Library. Projects like Easy Find challenge you to use containers and iterators effectively, preparing you for more advanced algorithmic programming.

Module 09 – STL (Standard Template Library)
Finally, apply your knowledge in full-fledged applications using the STL. Exercises such as Bitcoin Exchange, Reverse Polish Notation, and PmergeMe put your understanding of containers, algorithms, and exception handling to the test.

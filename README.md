Welcome to the **C++ OOP Projects** repository! This collection of exercises is designed to guide you through a progressive journey in Object-Oriented Programming with C++. Each module introduces new concepts and challenges‚Äîstarting with basic classes and culminating in advanced topics like STL usage and template programming.

## üöÄ Overview

The projects are organized into modules, each building upon the previous one:

- **Module 00 ‚Äì Fundamental Concepts**  
  *Topics:* Namespaces, classes, member functions, I/O streams, initialization lists, static members, and const correctness.  
  *Highlights:* Exercises like **Megaphone** and **My Awesome PhoneBook** lay the groundwork.

- **Module 01 ‚Äì Memory Management & Basic Pointers**  
  *Topics:* Memory allocation, pointers to members, references, and control structures.  
  *Highlights:* Exercises like **BraiiiiiiinnnzzzZ** and **Zombie Horde** clarify stack vs. heap allocation.

- **Module 02 ‚Äì Operator Overloading & Canonical Form**  
  *Topics:* Ad-hoc polymorphism and implementing classes in the Orthodox Canonical Form.  
  *Highlights:* Build a **fixed-point number** class to explore nuanced numerical representations.

- **Module 03 ‚Äì Inheritance**  
  *Topics:* Base and derived classes, code reuse, and method overriding.  
  *Highlights:* The **ClapTrap** exercise demonstrates how to inherit and extend behaviors.

- **Module 04 ‚Äì Polymorphism & Abstract Classes**  
  *Topics:* Subtype polymorphism, abstract classes, and interfaces.  
  *Highlights:* Create an **Animal** hierarchy where derived classes override base class methods.

- **Module 05 ‚Äì Repetition & Exception Handling**  
  *Topics:* Error handling and robust design with exceptions.  
  *Highlights:* Exercises like **Bureaucrat** and **Form** simulate real-world scenarios and enforce best practices.

- **Module 06 ‚Äì C++ Casts**  
  *Topics:* Type conversions using different C++ casts.  
  *Highlights:* Implement a **ScalarConverter** to understand the nuances of casting between scalar types.

- **Module 07 ‚Äì Templates**  
  *Topics:* Generic programming with function templates.  
  *Highlights:* Write versatile functions like `swap`, `min`, and `max` that work with any data type.

- **Module 08 ‚Äì Templated Containers, Iterators & Algorithms**  
  *Topics:* Leveraging the Standard Template Library (STL) for container management and algorithms.  
  *Highlights:* The **Easy Find** exercise shows how to efficiently search within containers.

- **Module 09 ‚Äì STL in Practice**  
  *Topics:* Advanced STL usage, including full applications.  
  *Highlights:* Projects like **Bitcoin Exchange**, **Reverse Polish Notation**, and **PmergeMe** integrate containers, algorithms, and exception handling in real-world scenarios.
